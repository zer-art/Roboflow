# G&SR Rules

This folder contains the **Static Database** of General & Subsidiary Rules and Network Topology.
- **Commit Strategy**: This data is text-based (JSON/XML) and relatively small. It **should be committed** to git so all developers share the same physics and rules definitions.
- `GSR_rules.json`: Digitized rulebook.
- `network.json`: Track layout graph.
